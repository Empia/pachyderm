## ./pachctl deploy amazon

Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on AWS.

### Synopsis


Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on AWS. Arguments are:
  <S3 bucket>: An S3 bucket where Pachyderm will store PFS data.
  <id>, <secret>, <token>: Session token details, used for authorization. You can get these by running 'aws sts get-session-token'
  <region>: The aws region where pachyderm is being deployed (e.g. us-west-1)
  <EBS volume names>: A comma-separated list of EBS volumes, one per rethink shard (see --rethink-shards).
  <size of volumes>: Size of EBS volumes, in GB (assumed to all be the same).


```
./pachctl deploy amazon <S3 bucket> <id> <secret> <token> <region> <EBS volume names> <size of volumes (in GB)>
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --deploy-rethink-as-rc          Deploy RethinkDB as a single-node cluster controlled by kubernetes ReplicationController, instead of a multi-node cluster controlled by a PetSet. This is for compatibility with GKE, which does not publicly support PetSets yet
      --dry-run                       Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
      --log-level string              The level of log messages to print options are, from least to most verbose: "error", "info", "debug". (default "info")
      --no-metrics                    Don't report user metrics for this command
      --rethink-shards int            The static number of RethinkDB shards (for pfs metadata storage). (default 1)
      --rethinkdb-cache-size string   Size of in-memory cache to use for Pachyderm's RethinkDB instance, e.g. "2G". Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc) (default "768M")
  -v, --verbose                       Output verbose logs
```
